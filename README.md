# INTRODUCTION
This project involves an in-depth analysis of the sales and order data from Northwind Traders, a fictional gourmet food supplier specializing in the import and export of unique food products from various countries. The dataset contains information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees, giving details on the operational dynamics of Northwind Traders. Through this analysis, I aim to derive valuable insights into the company's business trends and customer interactions, contributing to a better understanding of its market presence and operational performance.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
I will be using the provided dataset to understand customer spending patterns and make changes to the companies' sales and operational strategies to improve performance. Specifically, I aim to achieve the following goals:

1. Are there any noticeable sales trends over time?
2. Which are the best and worst-selling products?
3. Can you identify any key customers?
4. Are shipping costs consistent across providers?
5. Assess the sales contributions of individual employees
6. Investigate products that have been discontinued but are still being ordered
7. Explore the shipping interval from the order date

# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
For this project, I used the following skills and tools;
  ### EXCEL: I leveraged Excel for data cleaning; removing duplicate values, correcting formatting issues, handling missing data through imputation or deletion, and standardizing data formats for consistency, and transformation to ensure data quality.
  
  ### SQL: After cleaning and transforming my data on Excel, I created tables and imported the dataset into Postgresql for further analysis. I Utilized SQL queries to extract relevant information from the Northwind Traders database for in-depth analysis. I also integrated data from multiple tables using SQL join operations to establish meaningful relationships between different datasets.
  
  ### Power BI: After loading the dataset into Power BI, I used measures and DAX to aggregate the necessary data I needed. I also created an interactive dashboard to answer the business questions stated in the project objective section
___
# DATA TRANSFORMATION
After importing the data to Power BI, I did some transformations to add a date table for efficient time analysis. 
___
# DATA MODELLING
I have 7 tables and loading the dataset creates an automatic model, but I will be making adjustments to the auto model created by Power BI by changing the 'cross-filter direction' to 'Both' to allow more dynamic filtering. This model can be seen in the schema below
